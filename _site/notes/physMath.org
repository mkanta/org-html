* Equations
Equations in one variable are expressions of the form $L(x)=R(x)$ where
the variable $x$ is a placeholder for an unknown quantity. Solving an equation
menas to find one or more concrete values $x_0$ for which $L(x_0)$ actually 
equals $R(x_0)$. Such an $x_0$ is called a /solution/ of the equation. In the
simplest case, an equation is the form $x=C$ where $C$ does not depend on $x$.
In these simple cases, a solution $x_0=C$ can be read off directly. 

Solving equations involves a number of transformations of the original equation
$L(x)=R(x)$ with the goal of obtaining simple equations $x=C$ where the 
solutions can be read of directly. If the transformations are chosen with care,
the solutions of the transformed equations will be the same as those of the
original equation.

The general procedure to solve an equation consists of
 1) clearing denominators if necessary,
 2) expanding terms to remove parentheses,
 3) combining the terms that contain the variable to solve for and 
    those that don't,
 4) assembling these two types of terms at opposite sides.
The further treatment of the equation depends on its kind. 

As an example, consider \[4(x-3)+2=15-5(x+6).\] No denominators need clearing
and expanding the left hand side
of the equation leads to  
\[4\,x-12+2=15-5(x+6).\] Doing the same on the right results in
\[4\,x-12+2=15-5\,x-30.\] Now the constant terms on either side can be combined
to get
\[4\,x-10=-5\,x-15.\]
Adding $5x$ to both sides of the equation removes the term $-5x$ from the right
hand side 
\[9\,x-10=-15\]
and adding $10$ will remove the constant from the left hand side, so that
\[9\,x=-5.\] Finally, dividing both sides by $9$ gives the simple form
\[x=-{\frac{5}{9}},\] from which the result $x_0=-5/9$ can now be read off. In
order to verify the procedure, the original equation should be tested with
the result. For the left hand side,
\[4(\frac{5}{9}-3)+2=-{\frac{110}{9}}\]
whereas the right hand side yields
\[15-5*(-\frac{5}{9}+6) =-{\frac{110}{9}}\]
as well, thus confirming $-5/9$ as a solution.
** Operations on Equations
The previous example showed a number of operations on equations that changed
them to other equations that have the same solutions. Two equations that have
the same solutions are called equivalent. In the example above, 
$4(x-3)+2=15-5(x+6)$, $9\,x-10=-15$ and $x=-{\frac{5}{9}}$ are all equivalent
because they all have the same solution $x=-{\frac{5}{9}}$. The most common
operations on equations that transform an equation into an equivalent one are
 1) Expansions and simplifications such as ordering terms, which are done
    separately on the left and right hand side of the equation,
 2) Additions of terms on both sides, ie transforming $L(x)=R(x)$ to 
    $L(x)+C(x)=R(x)+C(x)$,
 3) Multiplying both sides of the equation by a nonzero term, ie 
    $L(x)=R(x)$ is transformed to $C(x)L(x)=C(x)R(x)$. The restriction that 
    $C(x)\not=0$ is important because it doesn't lead to an equivalent equation 
    as it adds solutions to an equation. For example $x=5$ has sole solution $5$
    but $(x-4)x=(x-4)5$ has $4$ as an additional solution. This will be 
    important to remember when solving rational equations which have to be 
    multiplied by terms containing the unknown to be solved for.
** Types of Equations
Equations can be classified into types according to their original appearance
or their appearance after all meaningful simplifications and transformations
are applied. For example, an equation where a variable occurs in the denominator
of a fraction is called a /rational/ equation. An equation where a variable
occurs in a root is a /radical/ equation. 

There is a plethora of equation types, one for pretty much every function.
For example, equations where a variable occurs in a $\sin$ function are called
trigonometric equations, equations where a variable occurs in an exponent
is called an exponential equation. Most of these can not be solved for
the variables in any meaningful way without resorting to numerical algorithms
except in special circumstances.

After all the transforming and collection of terms, if the final equation
can be brought to the form $L(x)=R$  where $L(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$ and 
$R$ is a constant then it is called a /polynomial/ equation. These are further
subclassified by degree. A /linear/ equation in $x$ is an equation where the
maximal degree of $x$ in $L(x)$ is one, so $L(x)=ax+b$. A /quadratic/ equation
is an equation where the maximal degree of $x$ in $L(x)$ is two, hence $L$
looks like $L(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ with constants $a, b, c$. 

Sometimes, equations classified according to their original appearance can be
reclassified according to their final form. For example, rational equations
can always be transformed to polynomial equations and thus can also be linear
or quadratic in addition to being rational.
** Quadratic Equations
Quadratic equations are equations where $L(x)$ in $L(x)=R$ has degree two in
$x$, so $L(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ with $a\not=0$. Assuming $R=0$ since any nonzero $R$
can be absorbed into the constant $c$, a quadratic equation has the form
\[ax^2+bx+c=0\] with $a\not=0$.
* Vectors in the Plane
Vectors are entities which have a direction in addition to a quantity. The
quantity associated with a vector is its /length/. The description of its
/direction/ depends on its ambient space. For vectors whose ambient space
is a two-dimensional plane, the /direction/ is often given as an angle with
respect to a fixed reference direction.
** Representations
There are two main representations for vectors in the plane, the representation
in cartesian coordinates and the representation in terms of length and angle
with respect to a reference direction. The latter is often called its /polar/
representation.

Whilst the polar representation is perhaps geometrically more intuitive, its
major deficiency is the way it reacts to the addition of vectors, which usually
involves heavy manipulations in trigonometry. By contrast, vectors in cartesian
representation can be added by simply adding their components. Since vector
addition is often required to solve physical problems, conversions between
the two representations are often required, or, at least convenient.
*** Cartesian Coordinates
A vector in the plane can be described by a cartesian coordinate system. More
precisely, the vector \(v=(v_1,v_2)\) is described by the point \(v_1,v_2\) it
points to from the origin. Since \(v_1\) is the x-coordinate of this point,
\begin{equation}
v_1=l \cos\alpha
\end{equation}
where \(l\) is the length of \(v\) and \(\alpha\) is the angle between \(v\) and
the x-axis. In a similar vein
\begin{equation}
v_2=l \sin\alpha.
\end{equation}
As for the length \(l\) of \(v\), a simple application of Pythagoras' theorem
yields
\begin{equation}
l=\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2}.
\end{equation}
Note that the length of a vector \(v\) is usually denoted by \(\| v\|\) rather
than \(l\).
*** Polar Coordinates
The polar coordinates \(v=(l,\alpha)\) of a vector \(v\) are simply its length
\(l\) and its angle \(\alpha\) with respect to the x-axis of the coordinate
system. The angle increases as the vector is rotated anti-clockwise about the
origin and decreases when rotated in a clockwise direction. 

Thus, if the x-axis is chosen to point east, angles north of east to west are 
considered positive in the range of 0 to 180 degrees whereas angles south of 
east are negative from 0 to -180 degrees. Due to the circular nature of angles,
180 degrees north of east is the same as 180 degrees south of east, so an angle
of 180 degrees in this context is the same as an angle of -180 degrees. 
*** Conversions
In all these examples and exercises assume the x-axis of the coordinate system i
points due east and all vectors start at the origin unless noted otherwise.
 1) Find the cartesian representation of a vector pointing south of east at
    \(30^\circ\) with a length of 10.
    Answer: The angle is south of east, hence \(-30^\circ\) and the vector
    in cartesian coordinates is 
    \(v=10(\cos(-30),\sin(-30))=10(cos(30),-sin(30))= (8.66025403784\),-5.0)\).
 2) Find the length and angle of vector \(v=(-1,1)\).
    Answer: The length of \(v\) is 
    \(\|v\|=\sqrt(-1^2+1^2)=\sqrt(2)=1.41421356237\).
    For the angle, \(\sqrt(2)*\cos(\alpha)=-1\), hence
    \(\cos(\alpha)=\frac{-1}{\sqrt(2)}=-0.707106781188\) and
    \(\alpha=\arccos(-0.707106781188)=135.0\).

    Note that looking at the second coordinate leads to a discrepancy in
    angles because  
    \(\sin(\alpha)=\frac{1}{\sqrt(2)}=0.707106781188\) and
    \(\alpha=\arcsin(0.707106781188)=45.0000000001\). This occurs because
    \(\sin(45.0)=0.707106781187=\sin(135.0)\) so the /arcsin/ function
    cannot distinguish between those angles. The proper handling of this
    situation and why \(135^\circ\) is the right answer in this case
    will be discussed below.
 3) Find the cartesian representation of a vector pointing north east at
    angle \(60^\circ\) and with length \(5\).

 4) Find the cartesian coordinates of a vector pointing north west at 
    \(120^\circ\) and with length \(15\).
 5) Find the cartesian coordinates of a vector with angle \(300^\circ\)
    and length \(25\).

*** Angle Selection
Due to the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions, their inverses can
not distinguish between angles where they assume the same values. Thus, when
converting a vector from cartesian to polar, the proper angle has to be
selected. This selection is made based on the /quadrant/ the vector is in.
There are four quadrants.
 - Quadrant I :: This is the north-east of the coordinate system. Vectors
   in this quadrant have components that are both positive. When calculating
   angles with the inverse trigonometric functions for these vectors, the
   angle between \(0^\circ\) and \(90^\circ\) is chosen.
 - Quadrant II :: The north-west section of the coordinate system. Vectors
   here have negative \(x\) components and \(y\) components are still positive.
   Their angles are between \(90^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\).
 - Quadrant III :: The south-west. Vectors pointing into this section have
   components that are both negative. Here, angles are between \(180^\circ\)
   and \(270^\circ\).
 - Quadrant IV :: The south-east. Here, the \(y\) components are negative
   whilst the \(x\) components are positive. Angles are between \(270^\circ\)
   and \(360^\circ\).
In example 2) above, the \(x\) component is negative whereas the \(y\) component
is positive. Thus, the vector is in quadrant II and an angle between 
\(90^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\) should be chosen that satisfies the
formulas. This is the angle of \(135^\circ\) obtained from the \(x\) 
component.
 1) Convert \(v=(1,1)\): The length is \(\|v\|=\sqrt(2)\), resulting in
    \(\cos(\alpha)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) and a possible angle of 
    \(\alpha=\arccos(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})=44.9999999999\). The corresponding
    calculation using the second component yields the same result. The vector
    points into quadrant I so the value of \(45^\circ\) is acceptable.
 2) Convert \(v=(-1,-1)\): Again, the length is \(\|v\|=\frac{1}{\sqrt(2)}\).
    From the first component,
    \(\alpha=\arccos(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}})=135.0\). Using the second component,
    \(\alpha=\arcsin(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}})=-45.0000000001\). There is a problem
    here because \(v\) points into quadrant III and the angle should be
    between \(180^\circ\) and \(270^\circ\).
