* Analytic Geometry
Analytic geometry is about describing geometric objects by equations. For that
purpose, various types of coordinate systems are introduced that allow to
relate points to measurements of their locations. 

The purpose of this is to determine certain points of interest by algebraic
means, such as the points of intersections of various geometric objects. These
points will be the solutions of algebraic equations. 

As an example for a coordinate system in a plane,
an arbitrary reference point can be chosen as origin and the location of
every other point can be determined by describing how far to go along
the horizontal and the vertical from the origin in order to reach that point.

This introduces a variable $x$ to describe how far to go along the horizontal
and a corresponding $y$ to do the same for the vertical. By convention,
positive $x$-values indicate movement to the right, negative values movement
to the left. For the $y$ variable, positive values indicate positions reached
by going up whereas negative values are related to positions reached by going
down.

In the plane, geometric objects can thus be described by equations in two 
variables, $E(x,y)=0$. The geometric object described by this equation 
consists of all points $(x,y)$ in the plane for which the equation holds.

For example, a circle around the origin $(0,0)$ of a coordinate system with 
radius $1$ is described by the equation $x^2+y^2-1=0$. All pairs $(x,y)$ of 
points in the plane for which the equation holds are points on the circle. 

A number of these equations occur frequently enough to warrant particular
attention.
** Coordinate Systems
There are two types of coordinate systems in common use. For both of them,
a reference point, called the origin, is chosen together with a unit of length 
and a direction.
 - Cartesian coordinates :: Here additional directions are chosen depending 
                on the dimension
                of the space the points are in. Usually, these directions are
                chosen at right angles to simplify calculations. Points are 
                described by tuples describing how far to go along the
                theses directions in order to reach the point.

                For example, in the plane the first direction chosen is often
                the horizontal to the right, often called the \(x\)-axis, and 
                the second the vertical, often called the \(y\)-axis, going
                upwards. A point like $(-5,3)$ in the plane is reached by 
                going $5$ units to the left along the horizontal direction 
                and then $3$ units up. 

                This can be generalised easily to higher dimensions by
                adding more directions. In space, the \(x\)-axis is still
                horizontal to the right. The \(y\)-axis, however, is usually
                chosen to be the depth pointing towards the observer.
                The \(z\)-axis usually points upwards at a right angle to the
                plane defined by $x$ and $y$ axis.
                Here, point $(-5,3,6)$ would be reached by going $5$ units to 
                the left, $3$ units towards the observer and $6$ units up.

 - Polar coordinates :: Here, points are described by angles with the chosen
                direction and the straight distance from the origin. These
                coordinates are most popular in low dimensions, up to 3D, 
                after that they are difficult to handle.
              
                In the plane, the horizontal axis pointing to the right is
                usually chosen as the direction. The point $(30:2)$ would
                be reached by rotating the \(x\)-axis $30^\circ$ counterclockwise
                about the origin and then moving $2$ units away from the
                origin along this rotated \(x\)-axis.

                An example where polar coordinated are used in 3 dimensions
                would be in geographical coordinates where the latitude of
                a point is its angle with the equatorial plane of the eart
                and its longitude its angle with the plane cutting the earth
                along the meridian of Greenwich.

** Lines
Lines are described by linear equations
#+NAME: lineEquation 
\begin{equation}
Ax+By+C=0
\end{equation} 
with constants $A$, $B$ and $C$. 
Note that if $B=0$, the line is of the form $Ax+C=0$, which
is satisfied by all points $(x,y)$ where $x=-\frac{C}{A}$ and arbitrary $y$
if $A\not=0$. This is a line parallel to the \(y\)-axis 
through $(-\frac{C}{A},0)$. If $A=B=0$  then all bets are off.

If $B\not=0$, equation ([[lineEquation]]) is often rewritten in /slope-intercept/ 
form as 
#+NAME: lineSlopeForm
\begin{equation}
y=mx+b
\end{equation}
where $m=-\frac{A}{B}$, $b=-\frac{A}{B}$. 

The constant $m$ is called the /slope/ of the line because it
describes the inclination of the line with respect to the \(x\) axis, more 
precisely $m=\tan \alpha$ where $\alpha$ is the angle between the line and the 
\(x\)-axis. Note that lines parallel to the \(y\)-axis can not be written in
this way because they have no slope as $\tan 90^\circ$ is not defined. 
This is precisely the case when $B=0$ in equation ([[lineEquation]]).

The constant $b$ in equation ([[lineSlopeForm]]) is called the /intercept/.
It describes where the line hits the \(y\)-axis because for $x=0$,
$y=b$ so the point $(0,b)$ is on the line. Since its first coordinate is zero,
it is a point on the \(y\)-axis.

Lines are often determined by two points. The equation of a line through two 
points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ where $x_1\not=x_2$ can be obtained as
#+NAME: slopeForm
\begin{equation}
y-y_1=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}(x-x_1)
\end{equation}
 or
#+Name: slopeFormClear
\begin{equation}
y=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}x+y_1-\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}x_1.
\end{equation}
From this, slope $m$ and intercept $b$ can be read off directly as
#+NAME: slopeFromPoints
\begin{equation}
m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
\end{equation}
and
#+NAME: interceptFromPoints
\begin{equation}
b=y_1-\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}x_1=y_1-mx_1.
\end{equation}

If $x_1=x_2$ then the slope is not defined. Obviously, the line is parallel to 
the \(y\)-axis in that situation and has equation $x=x_1$. This, again, is the 
case where $B=0$ in equation ([[lineEquation]]).

The ratio $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$, ie the slope of the line, is often 
referred to as /rise/ over /run/ in textbooks because it describes how the 
line rises (difference in \(y\)-values) as it runs along the \(x\)-axis 
(difference in \(x\)-values).

Note that equation ([[slopeForm]]) can also be written as
\[(x_2-x_1)(y-y_1)=(y_2-y_1)(x-x_1)\] or
\[-(y_2-y_1)x+(x_2-x_1)y +x_1(y_2-y_1)-y_1(x_2-x_1)=0\]
which has the same form as equation ([[lineEquation]]) with $A=-(y_2-y_1)$,
$B=x_2-x_1$ and $C=x_1(y_2-y_1)-y_1(x_2-x_1)$. This equation always works
without any worries about undefined slopes. The only tripping point here is the
order of the point coordinates, which has to be followed meticously to avoid
sign errors.
*** Line Calculations
When calculating lines it is often desirable to calculate the /slope-intercept/
form ([[slopeForm]]), so the slope $m$ and the intercept $b$ have to be calculated
if possible.
**** Line from Two Points
 - Determine the line through $(-5,3)$, $(5,-2)$:
   
   With $x_1=-5$, $y_1=3$ and $x_2=5$, $y_2=-2$,
   equation ([[slopeFromPoints]]) yields the slope
   \[m=\frac{-2-3}{5-(-5)}=\frac{-2-3}{5+5}=\frac{-5}{10}=-\frac{1}{2}\]
   and equation ([[interceptFromPoints]]) yields the intercept
   \[b=3-\frac{-2-3}{5-(-5)}(-5)=3-(-\frac{1}{2})(-5)=3-\frac{5}{2}=\frac{1}{2},\]
   hence the equation of the line through these two points is
   \[y=-\frac{1}{2}x-\frac{7}{2}.\] The line itself is the set
   \[\left\{(x,y)\left|y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}\right.\right\}.\]

 - Determine the line through $(3,2)$, $(3,-5)$:

   Here $x_1=x_2=3$, so this is the situation where the slope is not defined.
   As discussed above, the line has equation $x=3$ and the $y$ coordinate can
   be chosen at will. The line itself is the set
   \[\{(3,y)|y\mbox{ arbitrary}\}.\]

 - Determine the line through $(1,7)$, $(3,1)$.
 - Determine the line through $(2,3)$, $(-5,3)$.
 - Determine the line through $(1,1)$, $(3,7)$.
In practice, lines are easier to determine using a computer algebra system like
maxima. Instead of using the formulas above, the problem of determining lines
from two points can be reduced to solving a pair of linear equations. For
example the line through $(1,7)$ and $(3,1)$ can be obtained from the maxima
code below.
#+BEGIN_SRC maxima
  eq1:7=m+b; /*plug point (1,7) into y=mx+b and call the equation eq1*/
  eq2:1=m*3+b; /*dito for point (3,1) but call the equation eq2*/
  /*Now solve the system of linear equations eq1, eq2 for variables m and b*/
  linsolve([eq1,eq2],[m,b]); 
#+END_SRC
**** Line from Intercept and Point

In a sense this is easier than calculating a line from two points because the
intercept $b$ is already known. So all that needs to be done is to put the
given point into $y=mx+b$ and then to solve for $m$. 

Note that if the given point is on the \(y\)-axis, that is of the form 
$(0,y_0)$, this presents a special situation since the slope drops out of the 
equation due to $x$ being zero and cannot be solved for.
But it is pretty clear what happens here: if the point is different from the
intercept, the only possible line is the \(y\)-axis itself, ie the line $x=0$,
if it coincides with the intercept then any line through it works because there
is only one anchor point for the line.
 - Find the line through $(3,4)$ with intercept $-8$:

   Inserting the known values $b=-8$, $x=3$ and $y=4$ into the slope-intercept
   form ([[lineSlopeForm]]) of the line equation results in $4=3m-8$. After solving
   this for $m$, $m=4$ is obtained and the equation of the line is found to be
   $y=4x-8$.

 - Find the line through $(3,-4)$ with intercept $8$.
 - Find the line through $(-2,7)$ and intercept $2$.
 - Find the line through $(-2,7)$ and intercept $-2$.
 - Find the line through $(0,1)$ and intercept $4$.
 - Find the line through $(0,2)$ and intercept $2$.

**** Other Line Calculations
# Line through point and parallel to ...
# Line through point and perpendicular to ...
***** Intersections of lines

Here, two lines $y=m_1x+b_1$ and $y=m_2x+b_2$ are given and a point $(x_0,y_0)$
is to be found which resides on both of them. This point must satisfy both
equations, ie $y_0=m_1x_0+b_1$ and $y_0=m_2x_0+b_2$. Whilst technically a
system of two equations to be solved for $x_0$, $y_0$, the variable $y_0$ can
easily be eliminated because the two equations entail
\[ m_1x_0+b_1=m_2x_0+b_2, \]
which only has one unknown $x_0$. Solving for $x_0$ and plugging the result into
any of the two line equations will yield the intersection point.
 - Calculate the intersection of the lines $y=2x+1$ and $y=x-1$:
   The \(x\)-coordinate of the intersection has to satisfy $2x+1=x-1$. Combining
   like terms yields $x+2=0$ or $x=-2$. The corresponding \(y\)-value can
   then be obtained from $y=x-1$ as $y=-2-1=-3$ so that the intersection is at
   $(-2,-3)$.
 - Calculate the intersection of the lines $y=-3x+5$ and $y=\frac{1}{3}x+1$.
 - Calculate the intersection of $y=2x-1$ and $y=x+1$.
 - Calculate the intersection of $y=3x+1$ and $y=3x+5$. What's the problem here?
# $(\frac{6}{5},\frac{7}{5})$, $(2,3)$, No intersection, thus lines are parallel.
***** Line parallel to another line 

Since parallel lines have the same slope, calculating a line parallel to another
line requires another point. In order to calculate a line parallel to $y=mx+b$
and through $(x_0,y_0)$ only the intercept has to be calculated.
 - Find the line parallel to $y=3x+5$ going through $(2,-1)$:
   The requested line has slope $3$, hence it is of the form $y=3x+b$ for some
   unknown $b$. Inserting $(2,-1)$ into this equation establishes $-1=3*2+b$ as
   condition for $b$. Solving for $b$ yields $b=-7$ and $y=3x-7$ for the line.
 - Find the line parallel to $y=4x-6$ and going through $(1,1)$.
 - Find the line parallel to $y=-3x-2$ and going through $(3,4)$.
 - Find the line parallel to $y=-x+3$ and going through $(-2,7)$.

**** Best Fit Line

The calculation of a best fit line is a problem that occurs frequently in the
context of data analysis. A set of points $(x_i,y_i)$ is obtained from some
sort of measurement, usually forming some sort of cloud. The objective is
to find a line $y=mx+b$ that fits best in some sense. There are many
possibilities to define what this means but the definition used most often is
the line which minimises the sum of squared distances $(y_i-(mx_i+b))^2$ taken
over all data points $(x_i,y_i)$. This kind of best fit line is also called
the least squares line.
# and $(\frac{\overline{X^2}}{\overline{X}},\frac{\overline{XY}}{\overline{X}})$
A closer analysis of this reveals that the line of best fit contains the point
$(\overline{X},\overline{Y})$ 
where the bar denotes averages: $\overline{X}$ is the average of the $x_i$, 
and $\overline{Y}$ the average of the y-components $y_i$ of the datapoints. 
This results in relation
#+NAME: bfl_slope_intercept
\begin{equation}
\overline{Y}=m\overline{X}+b
\end{equation}
between the slope $m$ and the intercept $b$.
Defining 
\[ \overline{XY}=\mbox{average of the products }x_iy_i\]
and
\[ \overline{X^2}=\mbox{average of the squares }x_i^2\]
the slope of the best fit line turns out to be
\begin{equation}
m=\frac{\bar{X}\bar{Y}-\overline{XY}}{
\overline{X}^2-\overline{X^2}}
\end{equation} 
Note that $\overline{X^2}$ and $\overline{X}^2$ are not the same: the latter
is the square of the averages $\overline{X}$ of the $x_i$ whereas the former
is the average of the squares $x_i^2$ of the $x_i$. In a similar vein, 
$\bar{X}\bar{Y}$ is the product of the averages of the $x_i$ and $y_i$, respectively,
whereas $\overline{XY}$ denotes the average of the individual products $x_iy_i$.
Taking into consideration the relationship ([[bfl_slope_intercept]]), the intercept
of the best fit line turns out to be
\[
b=\overline{Y}-\frac{\bar{X}\bar{Y}-\overline{XY}}{\overline{X}^2-\overline{X^2}}\overline{X}.
\]

** Conic Sections
Conic sections are geometric objects defined by quadratic equations
#+NAME: generalConic
\begin{equation}
Ax^2+By^2+Cxy+Dx+Ey+F=0.
\end{equation}
These include circles, ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas. 

Common calculations involving conic sections consist of determining the 
intersections of conics with other conics or those of conics with lines.

In addition, there are several normal forms that need to be calculated on
occasion. For example, the circle with radius $r$ about centre-point
$(c_x, c_y)$ has equation \[(x-c_x)^2+(y-c_y)^2=r^2,\] which is considered
the normal form of the circle equation, and a common question
is whether a general conic of the form  ([[generalConic]]) can be transformed
into this normal form.
** Parabolas
Of particular interest for physical applications are parabolas, which are 
described by quadratic equations of the form \[y=ax^2+bx+c.\]
They are of physial interest in mechanics, because they describe, among other 
things, the trajectories of objects subject to constant acceleration. For 
example, a freely falling body has displacement
\[s(t)=s_i+v_it-\frac{1}{2}gt^2\]
at time $t$, where $s_i$ is its initial position, $v_i$ its initial velocity
and $g$ the acceleration due to gravity, about $9.81\frac{m}{s^2}$. This means
it traces out a parabola in a coordinate system plotting displacement $s$ vs. 
time $t$.
 1) <<golfExample>> A golfer propels a ball at $75\frac{m}{s}$ at an angle of $16^\circ$
   from an elevation of $2m$.
    - How long does the golf-ball fly?
      Calculating the vertical trajectory, we have an initial position of 
      $s_i=2m$, an initial verical velocity component of $v_i=\sin(16^\circ)*75$
      and an equation of vertical motion of 
      \[s(t)=2+75\sin(16^\circ)t-\frac{1}{2}9.81t^2,\] which can be used to determine
      how long the ball flies before it hits the ground, which corresponds
      to time $t_0$ satisfying $s(t_0)=0$. Thus, we have to solve 
      $-\frac{1}{2}9.81t^2+75\sin(16)t+2=0$ for $t$. 
      Translating this into a maxima session, note that maxima's trigonometric
      functions only take angles in radians, hence the ~%pi*16/180~ as argument
      of the $\sin$ function,
      #+BEGIN_SRC maxima
        tzero:solve(-1/2*9.81*t^2+sin(%pi*16/180)*75*t+2=0,t),numer;
      #+END_SRC
      will result in 
      #+RESULTS:
      $$\left[ t=-0.0946211718035283 , t=4.309259639953359 \right]. $$
      So there are two possibilities, one in the past, where $t<0$ and
      another one in the future where $t>0$, which is the solution of interest.

    - How far will the golf-ball fly?
      The horizontal movement is uniform given by $s(t)=s_i+v_it$. Choosing the
      coordinate system so that its \(x\)-coordinate is zero at the golfer's
      position, $s_i=0$ and the equation for horizontal movement is 
      $s(t)=cos(16^\circ)*75*t$. For $t$ the second solution from the previous
      calculation has to be extracted, which is the right-hand-side of the 
      second entry in ~tzero~, ie ~rhs(tzero[2])~ in maxima parlance. Thus
      #+BEGIN_SRC maxima
        tzero:solve(-1/2*9.81*t^2+sin(%pi*16/180)*75*t+2=0,t),numer;
        dist:cos(%pi*16/180)*75*rhs(tzero[2]),numer;
      #+END_SRC
      is the corresponding maxima session, again with the $16^\circ$ replaced
      by its radians $\pi\frac{16}{180}$. The result is
      #+RESULTS:
        : 310.6744672305086m.

 2) <<golf_exercise_1>> A golfer propels a ball at $70\frac{m}{s}$ at an angle of $15^\circ$
   from an elevation of $5m$. How long and how far will the golf ball fly?

 3) <<golf_exercise_2>> A golfer propels a ball at $65\frac{m}{s}$ at an angle of $30^\circ$
   from an elevation of $2.5m$. How long and how far will the golf ball fly?
*** Normal Form
As for circles, there is a normal form for the equation of a parabola. It
looks like
#+NAME: normalParabola
\begin{equation}
y=a(x-v_x)^2+v_y
\end{equation}
and is sometimes referred to as vertex-form of the parabola. The vertex of a
parabola is defined as be the point where it intersects its axis of symmetry
and can be read off of equation ([[normalParabola]]) as $(v_x,v_y)$.

The importance of the vertex lies with the fact that it is either a maximum
or a minimum when viewing $y$ in $y=a(x-v_x)^2+v_y$ as a function of $x$.
Since the square of a real number is always positive or zero $(x-v_x)^2=0$
if $x=v_x$ hence the expression $(x-v_x)^2$ reaches its minimum there. As for
$y=a(x-v_x)^2$, it will reach a minimum at the vertex if $a$ is positive and
a maximum if $a$ is negative. 

Going back to golfing example ([[golfExample]]) above, questions concerning the 
maximum height of the golf-ball and when it reaches that maximum can now be 
answered, provided the equation for its vertical movement is converted to the 
normal form ([[normalParabola]]). This can be achieved by a procedure known as
/completing the square/ and which is based on the formula
#+NAME: binomial2
\begin{equation}
(x+c)^2=x^2+2cx+c^2
\end{equation}
for the square. Given an expression
#+NAME: generalParabola
\begin{equation}
x^2+ax+b,
\end{equation} 
a comparison of the coefficients
of the \(x\)-terms reveals that writing $a=2\frac{a}{2}$  transforms this to
$x^2+2\frac{a}{2}x+b$. Now adding $\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2$ would give 
$x^2+2\frac{a}{2}+\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2=(x+\frac{a}{2})^2$ but it would change equation
([[generalParabola]]) into something else, unless $\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2$ was substracted 
again. Doing that results in
#+NAME: completingSimpleSquare
\begin{equation}
x^2+ax+b=x^2+2\frac{a}{2}x+\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2+b-\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2=
\left(x+\frac{a}{2}\right)^2+b-\frac{a^2}{4}.
\end{equation} 
The expression $\left(x+\frac{a}{2}\right)^2+b-\frac{a^2}{4}$ is then the
completed square of $x^2+ax+b$.

In general, there will be a coefficient in front of the $x^2$ term so that
expressions of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ will need to have their square completed.
This requires factoring out $a$ first before completing the square resulting
in
#+NAME: completingSquare
\begin{eqnarray}
ax^2+bx+c=a\left(x^2+2\frac{b}{2a}x\right)+c&=& \\
a\left(x^2+2\frac{b}{2a}+\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2-\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\right)+c
&=& \\
a\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+c-\frac{b^2}{4a},
\end{eqnarray}
so that
$a\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+c-\frac{b^2}{4a}$ is considered the completed
square of $ax^2+bx+c$.

There is no native function in maxima that completes the square, so we have
to implement one ourselves.
#+BEGIN_SRC maxima
(%i1)  completeSquare(expr,var):= 
          if coeff(expr,var,2)=0 then expr
          else coeff(expr,var,2)*(var+coeff(expr,var,1)/(2*coeff(expr,var,2)))^2
              +coeff(expr,var,0)-coeff(expr,var,1)^2/(4*coeff(expr,var,2))$
#+END_SRC 
This just returns the input expression if it has no quadratic term in its
variable and computes the completed square otherwise.
Testing this:
#+BEGIN_SRC maxima
(i%2)  completeSquare(a*x^2+b*x+c,x);
#+END_SRC
~(o%2)~ \[a\,\left(x+{{b}\over{2\,a}}\right)^2+c-{{b^2}\over{4\,a}}\]
Now check by expanding the completed square, this should give the original
equation back:
#+BEGIN_SRC maxima
  (%i3) expand(%);
#+END_SRC
~(%o3)~ \[a\,x^2+b\,x+c\]
Remember that ~%~ refers to the previous result, so this would be the same as
calling ~expand(completeSquare(a*x^2+b*x+c))~.
Before closing the maxima session, the function should be saved so it doesn't
have to be redefined every time it is needed:
#+BEGIN_SRC maxima
  (%i4) stringout("myFunctions.mac",functions)$
#+END_SRC
It can then later be reloaded with the ~load~ command. Note that this saves
the file ~myFunctions.mac~ in the current directory as seen from maxima. Running
~getcurrentdirectory();~ in the maxima session will reveal what maxima considers
its current directory. If this directory is not convenient, a full path for
the functions file can be given in the ~stringout~ command, depending on the
operating system maxima runs on. On android, in particular, maxima may not have
write permissions for its current directory and files have to be saved in the
~Documents~ or ~Downloads~ folder.
 1) Returning now to example ([[golfExample]]), the following questions can be answered:
 - When does the golf-ball from example ([[golfExample]]) reach its maximum
   height?

   Completing the square of the parabola 
   $s(t)=2+75\sin(16^\circ)t-\frac{1}{2}9.81t^2$ describing the vertical motion
   using maxima yields
   #+BEGIN_SRC maxima
     (%i4) completeSquare(2+75*sin(%pi*16/180)*t-9.81/2*t^2,t),numer;
   #+END_SRC
    ~(%o4)~ \[23.78209630785177-4.905\,\left(t-2.107319234074917\right)^2\]
   The squared term $\left(t-2.107319234074917\right)^2$ has negative
   coefficient $-4.905$ so the completed square version 
   \[s(t)=23.78209630785177-4.905\,\left(t-2.107319234074917\right)^2\]
   of the vertical displacement function is at a maximum when
   $\left(t-2.107319234074917\right)=0$, ie when $t=2.107319234074917$. Thus,
   the golf-ball reaches its maximum at about 2 seconds into its flight,
   more precisely at $t=2.107319234074917$ seconds.

 - What is the maximum height the golf-ball reaches during its flight?

   This could be answered by evaluating $s(t)$ at $t=2.107319234074917$.
   However, it is easier to read this directly off the completed square
   \[s(t)=23.78209630785177-4.905\,\left(t-2.107319234074917\right)^2\]
   because at the maximum, the quadratic term is zero and all that is left
   is the constant term $23.78209630785177$, which represents the maximum
   height.
 - What is the horizontal component of the distance of the golfer from
   the golf-ball when it reaches its maximum?

   To answer this, the function for the horizontal displacement 
   \[s_h(t)=\cos(16^\circ)75t\] has to be evaluated at the time 
   $t=2.107319234074917$ when the maximum is reached:
   #+BEGIN_SRC maxima
     (%i5) ev(cos(%pi*16/180)*75*t,t=2.107319234074917,numer);
   #+END_SRC
     ~(%o5)~ \[ 151.926394562272\]
   Thus, in a coordinate system that tracks the height of the golf-ball
   depending on its horizontal distance from the golfer, the point
   \[(151.926394562272,23.78209630785177)\] is the point where the maximum
   is reached.
 2) In a similar way, discuss the maximum heights of the golf balls and their
    corresponding positions for the exercises ([[golf_exercise_1]]) and
    ([[golf_exercise_2]]).
*** Tangent Lines
For every parabola, there are three kind of lines
 - lines that don't intersect the parabola
 - lines that intersect the parabola in two points
 - lines that intersect the parabola in one point.
The lines that intersect the parabola in only one point are called 
/tangent lines/ and they are of special interest in many physical applications.

The points of intersection of a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ with a line $y=mx+n$ have
\(x\)-coordinates satisfying \[mx+n=ax^2+bx+c\] or \[ax^2+bx+c-mx-n=0,\] which
is a quadratic equation
#+NAME:line_parabola
\begin{equation}
ax^2+(b-m)x+c-n=0
\end{equation}
Completing the square on this equation in maxima results in
#+BEGIN_SRC maxima
  (%i6) completeSquare(a*x^2+(b-m)*x+c-n,x);
#+END_SRC
  ~(%o6)~ \[a\,\left(x+{{b-m}\over{2\,a}}\right)^2-n-{{\left(b-m\right)^2 }\over{4\,a}}+c\]
so that the \(x\)-coordinates of the intersection points must satisfy
\[
a\,\left(x+{{b-m}\over{2\,a}}\right)^2-n-{{\left(b-m\right)^2
 }\over{4\,a}}+c=0
\]
or
#+NAME:line_parabola_normal
\begin{equation}
\left(x+{{b-m}\over{2\,a}}\right)^2=\frac{n-c}{a}+{{\left(b-m\right)^2
 }\over{4\,a^2}}
\end{equation}
Since the left hand side of equation ([[line_parabola_normal]]) is a square and
thus always positive, it can have solutions for $x$ only if the right hand side
is positive or zero as well. If it is positive,
\[\frac{n-c}{a}+{{\left(b-m\right)^2 }\over{4\,a^2}}>0\] then
equation ([[line_parabola_normal]]) has two solutions following from
\[ \left(x+{{b-m}\over{2\,a}}\right)^2=\frac{n-c}{a}+{{\left(b-m\right)^2
 }\over{4\,a^2}}\]
Since the left hand side of equation ([[line_parabola_normal]]) is a square and
thus always positive, it can have solutions for $x$ only if the right hand side
is positive or zero as well. If it is positive,
\[ \frac{n-c}{a}+{{\left(b-m\right)^2 }\over{4\,a^2}}>0\] then
equation ([[line_parabola_normal]]) has two solutions following from
\[ x+{{b-m}\over{2\,a}}=\sqrt{\frac{n-c}{a}+{{\left(b-m\right)^2 }\over{4\,a^2}}}\]
and
\[ x+{{b-m}\over{2\,a}}=-\sqrt{\frac{n-c}{a}+{{\left(b-m\right)^2 }\over{4\,a^2}}},\]
respectively, because the square root is defined in that case. If, however,
\[ \frac{n-c}{a}+{{\left(b-m\right)^2 }\over{4\,a^2}}=0\] then equation
([[line_parabola_normal]]) has only one solution following from
\[ \left(x+{{b-m}\over{2\,a}}\right)^2=0, \] namely
\[ x+{{b-m}\over{2\,a}}=0 \] or
\[ x=-{{b-m}\over{2\,a}}.\]
Solving this equation for $m$ is the answer to a common problem in 
applications: Given a parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ and a point $(x,y)$ on that 
parabola, find the slope of the tangent line through that point. It is simply
#+NAME: parabola_tangent_slope 
\begin{equation}
m=2ax+b.
\end{equation}
Viewed as a function of $x$ whose value is the slope of the tangent line of
the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ at $x$, $m(x)=2ax+b$ is called the first derivative
of the function $y(x)=ax^+bx+c$.
*** The Slope of Tangent Lines and its Meaning
The slope of tangent lines to functions is of utmost importance in applications
and will be analysed here by way of the example of parabolas.

Harking back to the example of the golf ball, its vertical position is 
described by a function of the form $s(t)=at^2+bt+c$. A common question concerns
its instantaneous velocity at a certain time $t_0$ during its flight. On the
face of it, this doesn't make much sense because velocity is a change in 
position between two points in time defined as
\[v=\frac{s_2-s_1}{t_2-t_1},\]
which involves two points in time rather than one.

One way to deal with this apparent contradiction is to take a slightly different
view of velocity and consider it an average change of position over an interval
of time. Taking a positive number $h$, the instantaneous velocity $v(t_0)$ at 
$t_0$ can be written as
\[v(t_0)=\frac{s(t_0+h)-s(t_0-h)}{2h},\]
which is the displacement occuring around time $t_0$ from $s(t_0-h)$ to 
$s(t_0+h)$ taking $2h$ units of time. Calculating this in maxima, the result
is
#+BEGIN_SRC maxima
(%i7) dvt0:a*(t0+h)^2+b*(t0+h)+c-a*(t0-h)^2-b*(t0-h)-c$
(%i8) vt0: facsum(dvt0,x)/(2*h); /*expand dvt0 to a poynomial in x and
                                   divide by 2h */
#+END_SRC
~(o%8)~ \[2\,a\,t_{0}+b\]
Comparing this to equation ([[parabola_tangent_slope]]), this is just the slope 
of the tangent line to $s(t)=at^2+bt+c$ at $t_0$.

In summary, the slope of the tangent line of $s(t)$ at $t_0$ is the 
instantaneous velocity of the vertical motions at time $t_0$. More generally,
since the velocity describes a change in position, the slope of a tangent line
to a parabola $y(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ at a point $x_0$ describes the change of the
function $y(x)$ near the point $x_0$.

In the case of the parabola, the previous example shows that the definition of
the instantaneous velocity at $t_0$ does not depend on the time interval $h$
chosen to calculate the average velocity around time $t_0$. This is no longer
true for other functions. Consider $f(t)=t^3$ and calculate $f(t_0+h)-f(t_0-h)$:
#+BEGIN_SRC maxima
  (i%9) df3:facsum((t0+h)^3-(t0-h)^3,x);
#+END_SRC
~(o%9)~ \[2\,h\,\left(3\,t0^2+h^2\right)\]
Here, $3t^2+h^2$ will be left after dividing by the time interval $2h$, so
\[\frac{f(t+h)-f(t-h)}{2h}\]
is no longer independent of the environment $h$ chosen around the point $t_0$.
* Equations
Equations in one variable are expressions of the form $L(x)=R(x)$ where
the variable $x$ is a placeholder for an unknown quantity. Solving an equation
means to find one or more concrete values $x_0$ for which $L(x_0)$ actually 
equals $R(x_0)$. Such an $x_0$ is called a /solution/ of the equation. In the
simplest case, an equation is the form $x=C$ where $C$ does not depend on $x$.
In this case, a solution $x_0=C$ can be read off directly. 

Solving equations involves a number of transformations of the original equation
$L(x)=R(x)$ with the goal of obtaining simple equations $x=C$ in order to 
read off the solutions directly. If the transformations are chosen with care,
the solutions of the transformed equations will be the same as those of the
original equation.

The general procedure to solve an equation consists of
 1) clearing denominators if necessary,
 2) expanding terms to remove parentheses,
 3) combining the terms that contain the variable to solve for and 
    those that don't,
 4) assembling these two types of terms at opposite sides.
The further treatment of the equation depends on its kind. 
** Example
 As an example, consider \[4(x-3)+2=15-5(x+6).\] No denominators need clearing
 and expanding the left hand side
 of the equation leads to  
 \[4\,x-12+2=15-5(x+6).\] Doing the same on the right results in
 \[4\,x-12+2=15-5\,x-30.\] Now the constant terms on either side can be combined
 to get
 \[4\,x-10=-5\,x-15.\]
 Adding $5x$ to both sides of the equation removes the term $-5x$ from the right
 hand side 
 \[9\,x-10=-15\]
 and adding $10$ will remove the constant from the left hand side, so that
 \[9\,x=-5.\] Finally, dividing both sides by $9$ gives the simple form
 \[x=-{\frac{5}{9}},\] from which the result $x_0=-5/9$ can now be read off. In
 order to verify the procedure, the original equation should be tested with
 the result. For the left hand side,
 \[4(\frac{5}{9}-3)+2=-{\frac{110}{9}}\]
 whereas the right hand side yields
 \[15-5*(-\frac{5}{9}+6) =-{\frac{110}{9}}\]
 as well, thus confirming $-5/9$ as a solution.
** Operations on Equations
The previous example showed a number of operations on equations that changed
them to other equations that have the same solutions. Two equations that have
the same solutions are called equivalent. In the example above, 
$4(x-3)+2=15-5(x+6)$, $9\,x-10=-15$ and $x=-{\frac{5}{9}}$ are all equivalent
because they all have the same solution $x=-{\frac{5}{9}}$. The most common
operations on equations that transform an equation into an equivalent one are
 1) Expansions and simplifications such as ordering terms, which are done
    separately on the left and right hand side of the equation,
 2) Additions of terms on both sides, ie transforming $L(x)=R(x)$ to 
    $L(x)+C(x)=R(x)+C(x)$,
 3) Multiplying both sides of the equation by a nonzero term, ie 
    $L(x)=R(x)$ is transformed to $C(x)L(x)=C(x)R(x)$. The restriction that 
    $C(x)\not=0$ is important because it doesn't lead to an equivalent equation 
    as it adds solutions to an equation. For example $x=5$ has sole solution $5$
    but $(x-4)x=(x-4)5$ has $4$ as an additional solution. This will be 
    important to remember when solving rational equations which have to be 
    multiplied by terms containing the unknown to be solved for.
** Types of Equations
Equations can be classified into types according to their original appearance
or their appearance after all meaningful simplifications and transformations
are applied. For example, an equation where a variable occurs in the denominator
of a fraction is called a /rational/ equation. An equation where a variable
occurs in a root is a /radical/ equation. 

There is a plethora of equation types, one for pretty much every function.
For example, equations where a variable occurs in a $\sin$ function are called
trigonometric equations, equations where a variable occurs in an exponent
is called an exponential equation. Most of these can not be solved for
the variables in any meaningful way without resorting to numerical algorithms
except in special circumstances.

After all the transforming and collection of terms, if the final equation
can be brought to the form $L(x)=R$  where $L(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$ and 
$R$ is a constant then it is called a /polynomial/ equation. These are further
subclassified by degree. A /linear/ equation in $x$ is an equation where the
maximal degree of $x$ in $L(x)$ is one, so $L(x)=ax+b$. A /quadratic/ equation
is an equation where the maximal degree of $x$ in $L(x)$ is two, hence $L$
looks like $L(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ with constants $a, b, c$. 

Sometimes, equations classified according to their original appearance can be
reclassified according to their final form. For example, rational equations
can always be transformed to polynomial equations and thus can also be linear
or quadratic in addition to being rational.
** Quadratic Equations
Quadratic equations are equations where $L(x)$ in $L(x)=R$ has degree two in
$x$, so $L(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ with $a\not=0$. Assuming $R=0$ since any nonzero $R$
can be absorbed into the constant $c$, a quadratic equation has the form
#+NAME: quadeq
\begin{equation}
ax^2+bx+c=0
\end{equation}
with $a\not=0$.

If $b=0$ then the equation reads \[ax^2+c=0\] and is essentially linear in $x^2$
so this case can be solved by solving for $x^2$,
\[x^2=-\frac{c}{a},\]
and then taking square roots to obtain solutions $x_1=\sqrt{-\frac{c}{a}}$ and
$x_2=-\sqrt{-\frac{c}{a}}$. If $b\not=0$ it is possible to transform the 
original equation to the form $L(x)^2+C=0$ where $L(x)$ is a linear epression
in $x$ and $C$ a constant. This transformation is usually referred to as
/Completing the Square/. Another method to solve quadratic equations is by
factoring.
*** Completing the Square 
Solving quadratic equations by completing the square will always work.
It is based on the observation that
\[(x+D)^2=x^2+2\,D\,x+D^2\] so adding $\frac{B}{2}^2$ to an equation
#+NAME: quadeq:1
\begin{equation}
x^2+Bx+C=0
\end{equation}
results in \[x^2+Bx+\frac{B}{2}^2+C=\frac{B}{2}^2.\]
The part \[x^2+Bx+\left(\frac{B}{2}\right)^2=x^2+2\frac{B}{2}x+\left(\frac{B}{2}\right)^2 \] has the 
form \[x^2+2\,D\,x+D^2\] with $D=\frac{B}{2}$, so 
\[x^2+Bx+\left(\frac{B}{2}\right)^2=\left(x+\frac{B}{2}\right)^2\] and equation ([[quadeq:1]]) becomes
\[\left(x+\frac{B}{2}\right)^2+C=\left(\frac{B}{2}\right)^2\] 
or
\[\left(x+\frac{B}{2}\right)^2=\left(\frac{B}{2}\right)^2-C.\] Taking square roots gives
\[x+\frac{B}{2}=\pm\sqrt{\left(\frac{B}{2}\right)^2-C}\] and the solutions of ([[quadeq:1]])
are
#+NAME: quadsol:1
\begin{equation}
x_1=-\frac{B}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{B}{2}\right)^2-C}
\end{equation} 
and 
#+NAME: quadsol:2
\begin{equation}
x_2=-\frac{B}{2}-\sqrt{\left(\frac{B}{2}\right)^2-C}.
\end{equation}
Note that this can be used to solve the original equation ([[quadeq]]). Dividing
([[quadeq]]) by $a$ results in an equation of the form ([[quadeq:1]]) with 
$B=\frac{b}{a}$ and $C=\frac{c}{a}$. Thus, the solution ([[quadsol:1]]) becomes
\[x_1=-\frac{b}{2a}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2-\frac{c}{a}}\]
and ([[quadsol:2]])
\[x_2=-\frac{b}{2a}-\sqrt{\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2-\frac{c}{a}}.\]
Rewritten as
#+NAME: quadformula
\begin{equation}
x_{1/2}=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}
this is called the /Quadratic Formula/.

The process of completing the square is not only used to solve quadratic
equations but also to rewrite quadratic functions
#+NAME: quadfunc
\begin{equation}
f(x)=ax^2+bx+c
\end{equation}
as
#+NAME: quadfunc:1
\begin{equation}
f(x)=a\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+c-\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2.
\end{equation}

The form ([[quadfunc:1]]) is beneficial when trying to optimise function $f(x)$
because the square of real numbers is always positive. Thus, when $a$ is 
positive then $f(x)$ has a minimum when $x+\frac{b}{2a}=0$. If $a$ is
negative then $f(x)$ has a maximum there.

This is often used in physical problems involving the throwing of things into
the air. The formula for the vertical displacement of a thrown object at time
$t$ is 
#+NAME: accelmotion
\begin{equation}
 s(t)=s_i+v_it+\frac{1}{2}at^2 
\end{equation}
where $s_i$ is the initial position, $v_i$ the initial velocity and $a$ the 
acceleration. One of the questions in this context is when the object reaches 
its highest point. This can be answered by completing the square in formula
([[accelmotion]]). The acceleration here is the acceleration $g$ due to gravity,
so ([[accelmotion]]) looks like
\[ s(t)=s_i+v_it-\frac{1}{2}gt^2 \]
in a coordinate system where upwards displacement is positive since $g$ is
downwards acceleration. 
*** Factoring
Factoring a quadratic equation is often less involved than completing the
square but does not always work. It is based on the observation that a product
of two polynomials is zero if and only if one of the factors is zero. Thus,
if a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ can be written as a product 
\[ ax^2+bx+c=(A_1x+B_1)(A_2x+B_2)=0\] of linear factors then either
\[A_1x+B_1=0\] or
\[A_2x+B_2=0\] or both. In any case, the solutions of the original equation can
then be obtained by solving the linear equations.

The problem with this approach is finding the coefficients $A_1$, $B_1$, $A_2$
and $B_2$ of the linear factors. A particularly simple case for factoring
arises when the constant term $c$ in the quadratic equation is zero since then
equation ([[quadeq]]) becomes
\[ax^2+bx=0\] from which the variable $x$ can be factored out to obtain
\[x(ax+b)=0.\] For this to be zero, either $x=0$ or $ax+b=0$ so there are
two solutions, $x_1=0$ and $x_2=-b/a$.

Apart from this case, factoring should only be attempted when there are reasons
to expect that all solutions are rational, that is, of the form $x=-B/A$ where
$A$ and $B$ are integers. The reason that this might work is that the product
of linear factors $A_1x+B_1$ and $Ax_2+B_2$ is
\[(A_1x+B_1)(A_2x+B_2)= A_{1}\,A_{2}\,x^2+(A_{1}\,B_{2}+A_{2}\,B_{1})\,x+B_{1}\,B_{2}.\]
As a consequence, the coefficients in ([[quadeq]]) are of the form
$a=A_{1}\,A_{2}$, $b=A_{1}\,B_{2}+A_{2}\,B_{1}$ and $c=B_{1}\,B_{2}$,
indicating that $A_1$, $A_2$ divide $a$ and $B_1$, $B_2$ divide $b$. So the 
algorithm for factoring $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is
 1) Clear denominators in $a$, $b$, $c$ if necessary so that the new equation
    becomes $a'x^2+b'x+c$ with $a'$, $b'$, $c'$ integers
 2) List pairs (A,B) of integers such that $A$ divides $a'$ and $B$ divides $c'$.
 3) For any two (A_1,B_1) and (A_2,B_2) of these pairs, check whether
    $b'=A_{1}\,B_{2}+A_{2}\,B_{1}$ is satisfied
If there is such a pair, $a'x^2+b'x+c'=(A_1x+B_1)(A_2x+B_2)$ is a factorisation
of $a'x^2+b'x+c'$.

Sometimes, the factorization itself is not needed. In that case it suffices
to plug the values $\pm B/A$ obtained in step 2) above into the equation and
see if it is zero.
 
All this can be a lot of work depending on the number of divisors of $a'$ and 
$c'$, which may not even be rewarded since there is no guarantee that quadratic
equations with integer coefficients have integer solutions. That's why this
should only be attempted when there is a good chance that the solutions are
integer. Or, of course, if some piece of software is at hand that automates
the process.

As an aside, it is actually known that every polynomial of degree $n$ can be
factored into a product of $n$ linear factors, however only with coefficients
in the complex numbers, so this method can also be used with polynomial
equations of higher degree.

* Vectors in the Plane
Vectors are entities which have a direction in addition to a quantity. The
quantity associated with a vector is its /length/. The description of its
/direction/ depends on its ambient space. For vectors whose ambient space
is a two-dimensional plane, the /direction/ is often given as an angle with
respect to a fixed reference direction.
** Representations
There are two main representations for vectors in the plane, the representation
in cartesian coordinates and the representation in terms of length and angle
with respect to a reference direction. The latter is often called its /polar/
representation.

Whilst the polar representation is perhaps geometrically more intuitive, its
major deficiency is the way it reacts to the addition of vectors, which usually
involves heavy manipulations in trigonometry. By contrast, vectors in cartesian
representation can be added by simply adding their components. Since vector
addition is often required to solve physical problems, conversions between
the two representations are often required, or, at least convenient.
*** Cartesian Coordinates
A vector in the plane can be described by a cartesian coordinate system. More
precisely, the vector \(v=(v_1,v_2)\) is described by the point \(v_1,v_2\) it
points to from the origin. Since \(v_1\) is the x-coordinate of this point,
\begin{equation}
v_1=l \cos\alpha
\end{equation}
where \(l\) is the length of \(v\) and \(\alpha\) is the angle between \(v\) and
the x-axis. In a similar vein
\begin{equation}
v_2=l \sin\alpha.
\end{equation}
As for the length \(l\) of \(v\), a simple application of Pythagoras' theorem
yields
\begin{equation}
l=\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2}.
\end{equation}
Note that the length of a vector \(v\) is usually denoted by \(\| v\|\) rather
than \(l\).
*** Polar Coordinates
The polar coordinates \(v=(l,\alpha)\) of a vector \(v\) are simply its length
\(l\) and its angle \(\alpha\) with respect to the x-axis of the coordinate
system. The angle increases as the vector is rotated anti-clockwise about the
origin and decreases when rotated in a clockwise direction. 

Thus, if the x-axis is chosen to point east, angles north of east to west are 
considered positive in the range of 0 to 180 degrees whereas angles south of 
east are negative from 0 to -180 degrees. Due to the circular nature of angles,
180 degrees north of east is the same as 180 degrees south of east, so an angle
of 180 degrees in this context is the same as an angle of -180 degrees. 
*** Conversions
In all these examples and exercises assume the x-axis of the coordinate system i
points due east and all vectors start at the origin unless noted otherwise.
 1) Find the cartesian representation of a vector pointing south of east at
    \(30^\circ\) with a length of 10.
    Answer: The angle is south of east, hence \(-30^\circ\) and the vector
    in cartesian coordinates is 
    \(v=10(\cos(-30),\sin(-30))=10(cos(30),-sin(30))= (8.66025403784\),-5.0)\).
 2) Find the length and angle of vector \(v=(-1,1)\).
    Answer: The length of \(v\) is 
    \(\|v\|=\sqrt(-1^2+1^2)=\sqrt(2)=1.41421356237\).
    For the angle, \(\sqrt(2)*\cos(\alpha)=-1\), hence
    \(\cos(\alpha)=\frac{-1}{\sqrt(2)}=-0.707106781188\) and
    \(\alpha=\arccos(-0.707106781188)=135.0\).

    Note that looking at the second coordinate leads to a discrepancy in
    angles because  
    \(\sin(\alpha)=\frac{1}{\sqrt(2)}=0.707106781188\) and
    \(\alpha=\arcsin(0.707106781188)=45.0000000001\). This occurs because
    \(\sin(45.0)=0.707106781187=\sin(135.0)\) so the /arcsin/ function
    cannot distinguish between those angles. The proper handling of this
    situation and why \(135^\circ\) is the right answer in this case
    will be discussed below.

*** Angle Selection
Due to the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions, their inverses can
not distinguish between angles where they assume the same values. Thus, when
converting a vector from cartesian to polar, the proper angle has to be
selected. This selection is made based on the /quadrant/ the vector is in.
There are four quadrants.
 - Quadrant I :: This is the north-east of the coordinate system. Vectors
   in this quadrant have components that are both positive. When calculating
   angles with the inverse trigonometric functions for these vectors, the
   angle between \(0^\circ\) and \(90^\circ\) is chosen.
 - Quadrant II :: The north-west section of the coordinate system. Vectors
   here have negative \(x\) components and \(y\) components are still positive.
   Their angles are between \(90^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\).
 - Quadrant III :: The south-west. Vectors pointing into this section have
   components that are both negative. Here, angles are between \(180^\circ\)
   and \(270^\circ\).
 - Quadrant IV :: The south-east. Here, the \(y\) components are negative
   whilst the \(x\) components are positive. Angles are between \(270^\circ\)
   and \(360^\circ\).
In example 2) above, the \(x\) component is negative whereas the \(y\) component
is positive. Thus, the vector is in quadrant II and an angle between 
\(90^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\) should be chosen that satisfies the
formulas. This is the angle of \(135^\circ\) obtained from the \(x\) 
component.
 1) Convert \(v=(1,1)\): The length is \(\|v\|=\sqrt(2)\), resulting in
    \(\cos(\alpha)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) and a possible angle of 
    \(\alpha=\arccos(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})=44.9999999999\). The corresponding
    calculation using the second component yields the same result. The vector
    points into quadrant I so the value of \(45^\circ\) is acceptable.
 2) Convert \(v=(-1,-1)\): Again, the length is \(\|v\|=\frac{1}{\sqrt(2)}\).
    From the first component,
    \(\alpha=\arccos(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}})=135.0\). Using the second component,
    \(\alpha=\arcsin(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}})=-45.0000000001\). There is a problem
    here because \(v\) points into quadrant III and the angle should be
    between \(180^\circ\) and \(270^\circ\).
