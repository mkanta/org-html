* Vectors in the Plane
Vectors are entities which have a direction in addition to a quantity. The
quantity associated with a vector is its /length/. The description of its
/direction/ depends on its ambient space. For vectors whose ambient space
is a two-dimensional plane, the /direction/ is often given as an angle with
respect to a fixed reference direction.
** Representations
There are two main representations for vectors in the plane, the representation
in cartesian coordinates and the representation in terms of length and angle
with respect to a reference direction. The latter is often called its /polar/
representation.

Whilst the polar representation is perhaps geometrically more intuitive, its
major deficiency is the way it reacts to the addition of vectors, which usually
involves heavy manipulations in trigonometry. By contrast, vectors in cartesian
representation can be added by simply adding their components. Since vector
addition is often required to solve physical problems, conversions between
the two representations are often required, or, at least convenient.
*** Cartesian Coordinates
A vector in the plane can be described by a cartesian coordinate system. More
precisely, the vector \(v=(v_1,v_2)\) is described by the point \(v_1,v_2\) it
points to from the origin. Since \(v_1\) is the x-coordinate of this point,
\begin{equation}
v_1=l cos\alpha
\end{equation}
where \(l\) is the length of \(v\) and \(\alpha\) is the angle between \(v\) and
the x-axis. In a similar vein
\begin{equation}
v_2=l sin\alpha.
\end{equation}
As for the length \(l\) of \(v\), a simple application of Pythagoras' theorem
yields
\begin{equation}
l=\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2}.
\end{equation}
Note that the length of a vector \(v\) is usually denoted by \(\| v\|\) rather
than \(l\).
*** Polar Coordinates
The polar coordinates \(v=(l,\alpha)\) of a vector \(v\) are simply its length
\(l\) and its angle \(\alpha\) with respect to the x-axis of the coordinate
system. The angle increases as the vector is rotated anti-clockwise about the
origin and decreases when rotated in a clockwise direction. 

Thus, if the x-axis is chosen to point east, angles north of east to west are 
considered positive in the range of 0 to 180 degrees whereas angles south of 
east are negative from 0 to -180 degrees. Due to the circular nature of angles,
180 degrees north of east is the same as 180 degrees south of east, so an angle
of 180 degrees in this context is the same as an angle of -180 degrees. 
*** Conversions
In all these examples and exercises assume the x-axis of the coordinate system i
points due east and all vectors start at the origin unless noted otherwise.
 1) Find the cartesian representation of a vector pointing south of east at
    \(30\degrees\) with a length of 10.
    Answer: The angle is south of east, hence \(-30\degrees\) and the vector
    in cartesian coordinates is 
    \(v=10(\cos(-30),\sin(-30))=10(cos(30),-sin(30))= (8.66025403784\),-5.0)\).
 2) Find the length and angle of vector \(v=(-1,1)\).
    Answer: The length of \(v\) is 
    \(\|v\|=\sqrt(-1^2+1^2)=\sqrt(2)=\(1.41421356237\).
    For the angle, \(\sqrt(2)*\cos(\alpha)=-1\), hence
    \(\cos(\alpha)=\frac{-1}{\sqrt(2)}=-0.707106781188\) and
    \(\alpha=\arccos(-0.707106781188)=135.0\).

    Note that looking at the second coordinate leads to a discrepancy in
    angles because  
    \(\sin(\alpha)=\frac{1}{\sqrt(2)}=0.707106781188\) and
    \(\alpha=\arcsin(0.707106781188)=45.0000000001\). This occurs because
    \(\sin(45.0)=0.707106781187=\sin(135.0)\) so the /arcsin/ function
    cannot distinguish between those angles. The proper handling of this
    situation and why \(135\degrees\) is the right answer in this case
    will be discussed below.
 3) Find the cartesian representation of a vector pointing north east at
    angle \(60\degrees\) and with length \(5\).

 4) Find the cartesian coordinates of a vector pointing north west at 
    \(120\degrees\) and with length \(15\).
 5) Find the cartesian coordinates of a vector with angle \(300\degrees\)
    and length \(25\).
    Answer:\\\vspace{3in}
*** Angle Selection
Due to the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions, their inverses can
not distinguish between angles where they assume the same values. Thus, when
converting a vector from cartesian to polar, the proper angle has to be
selected. This selection is made based on the /quadrant/ the vector is in.
There are four quadrants.
 - Quadrant I :: This is the north-east of the coordinate system. Vectors
   in this quadrant have components that are both positive. When calculating
   angles with the inverse trigonometric functions for these vectors, the
   angle between \(0\degrees\) and \(90\degrees\) is chosen.
 - Quadrant II :: The north-west section of the coordinate system. Vectors
   here have negative \(x\) components and \(y\) components are still positive.
   Their angles are between \(90\degrees\) and \(180\degrees\).
 - Quadrant III :: The south-west. Vectors pointing into this section have
   components that are both negative. Here, angles are between \(180\degrees\)
   and \(270\degrees\).
 - Quadrant IV :: The south-east. Here, the \(y\) components are negative
   whilst the \(x\) components are positive. Angles are between \(270\degrees\)
   and \(360\degrees\).
In example 2) above, the \(x\) component is negative whereas the \(y\) component
is positive. Thus, the vector is in quadrant II and an angle between 
\(90\degrees\) and \(180\degrees\) should be chosen that satisfies the
formulas. This is the angle of \(135\degrees\) obtained from the \(x\) 
component.
 1) Convert \(v=(1,1)\): The length is \(\|v\|=\sqrt(2)\), resulting in
    \(\cos(\alpha)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) and a possible angle of 
    \(\alpha=\arccos(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})=44.9999999999\). The corresponding
    calculation using the second component yields the same result. The vector
    points into quadrant I so the value of \(45\degrees\) is acceptable.
 2) Convert \(v=(-1,-1)\): Again, the length is \(\|v\|=\frac{1}{\sqrt(2)}\).
    From the first component,
    \(\alpha=\arccos(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}})=135.0\). Using the second component,
    \(\alpha=\arcsin(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}})=\(-45.0000000001\). There is a problem
    here because \(v\) points into quadrant III and the angle should be
    between \(180\degrees\) and \(270\degrees\).
